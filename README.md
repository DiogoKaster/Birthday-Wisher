## What you'll need to change
Well, this is a program where I learned how to use SMTP and Datetime libraries. But
you really want this program to run properly, you'll have to put your email
and the password of this email in the constants that are created for it. This is 
needed because this code will open your desired email and send a letter from
it to the person that are registered in the CSV file. Also, to properly record
a person in the CSV file, you have to fill the data as it is separated by the
columns, otherwise the reading won't work as demanded.
